# The Show

A fun little baseball project created by 2 pals.

## Overview

Goal is to predict outcomes of baseball matches running a monte carlo simulation of sorts...

## Installing

No idea how this will be done yet but this is some kind of place holder...

Some code example in here showing it running from command line:

```
python the-show --t1 "Cardinals" --t2 "Sox"
```

Output will let us make \$\$\$.

## Running the tests

There will be some sort of testing suite that'll go a little like this:

```
python the-show run_tests
```

and get some kind of feedback

## Dependencies

Plan on using [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) for pulling up-to-date stats. I think it's legit just to include this?

## Deployment

Pretty sure we will just run it locally?

## Built With

- [Python](http://python.org/) - Yeah...

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute and give feedback. We are both just learning.

## Versioning

Using Git is our form of versioning I suppose?
